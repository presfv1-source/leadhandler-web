# LeadHandler Strategic Context

**Full context:** Read `docs/LEADHANDLER_MASTER_CONTEXT.md` for deep operational context (mission, ICP, architecture, Phase 0 checklist, risk zones, founder priorities).

## Phase 0 — Non-Negotiables

- **No major new features**; no architectural rewrites; no premature scaling.
- **No vanity UI** that doesn't improve clarity; no experimental complexity.
- **Actively resist feature creep.** Bias toward boring reliability before scaling.

## Architecture (Do Not Assume Migration)

- **Make.com** = primary automation brain (lead intake, AI, routing, conversations). Fragile but current.
- **Airtable** = system of record (brokerages, agents, leads, messages). Relational integrity must stay clean.
- **Twilio** = SMS transport; **Stripe** = billing. Both are hard dependencies.
- **Frontend** = auth, dashboard, onboarding, settings — not the primary logic engine.

## Near-Term Priorities (Order)

1. Twilio campaign stability  
2. End-to-end onboarding proof  
3. Stripe production wiring  
4. Demo polish  
5. Mobile responsiveness  
6. Dashboard accuracy  
7. Error elimination  
8. Data integrity validation  

## UI & Users

- **Tone:** Premium SaaS, clean, strong contrast, vibrant accents. Not pastel, not cheap template, not clutter.
- **Users:** Broker-owners are mostly **not technical**. UI must feel obvious, simple, fast, trustworthy.
- **Mobile:** Usable on iPhone, small Android, tablet. Avoid overflow tables, cut-off cards, tiny tap targets, broken sidebars.
- **Roles:** Owner has full access; Agent has limited view. Owner features must never disappear due to role bugs.

## Demo Mode

- Must feel realistic, valuable, believable; clearly labeled demo but not fake.
- No obvious placeholders, empty dashboards, or inconsistent names; no leak into real data.

## When Uncertain

> Choose the path that increases **reliability**, **clarity**, and **sales credibility**.

## Risk Zones (Be Cautious)

- **Twilio:** A2P, webhooks, number assignment, delivery drift.
- **Airtable:** Relational drift, orphans, scaling limits.
- **Make.com:** Scenario brittleness, silent failures, race conditions.
- **Stripe:** Webhook duplication, subscription state drift.
- **Frontend:** Role bugs, mobile regressions, auth edge cases, stale cache.

## Development Bias

Prefer: reliability, clarity, incremental improvement, fast load, obvious UX.  
Avoid: clever-but-fragile code, over-abstracted patterns, heavy new deps, premature microservices.
